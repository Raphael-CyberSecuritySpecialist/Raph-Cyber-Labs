# Linux Fundamentals Part 1

## Objective
Learn the basics of Linux, including interacting with the terminal, navigating the filesystem, running essential commands, searching for files, and using shell operators. Build foundational skills for cybersecurity and system administration.

## Environment
- TryHackMe interactive Linux terminal  
- Browser-based Linux environment  

## Tools Used
- Linux commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `find`, `grep`  
- Shell operators: `>`, `>>`, `|`  

## Steps Performed
1. Accessed the TryHackMe Linux terminal in-browser.  
2. Explored Linux basics, including its history and use cases (servers, IoT, desktops).  
3. Ran initial commands to interact with the filesystem:  
   - `pwd` – print current working directory  
   - `ls` – list files and directories  
   - `cd` – navigate directories  
4. Viewed file contents using `cat`.  
5. Searched for files and text using `find` and `grep`.  
6. Practiced using shell operators:  
   - `>` – redirect output to a file  
   - `>>` – append output to a file  
   - `|` – pipe output between commands  
7. Completed embedded TryHackMe tasks to reinforce learning.  

## Key Commands
```bash
pwd      # Show current directory
ls       # List files and directories
cd       # Change directory
cat      # Display file content
find     # Search for files
grep     # Search text in files
>        # Redirect output to a file
>>       # Append output to a file
|        # Pipe output between commands
